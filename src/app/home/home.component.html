      <div id="test4"> Doctors, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and vendors deserve easy to use tools that facilitate the process
        of planning, booking and billing for surgeries and procedures. Surgipal was created by a team of physicians to bring
        surgical preference cards into the digital age. Surgipal allows physicians to create, edit and manage their surgery
        or procedure preference cards online. Doctors and their staff setup, maintain and update their preference cards.
        Surgeries and procedures are scheduled online with preference cards specifically tailored to the patient. Hospitals,
        ASCs and vendors access these preferences anywhere and anytime for planning and booking purposes. Doctors can bill
        for surgeries online with the simple click of a button. Surgipal keeps a log of all your surgeries and procedures
        for practice analytics and research purposes. </div>
